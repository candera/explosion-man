This is my first major foray into Clojure. The intent is to write a
Swing game that's a clone of the old BomberMan game. I'm hoping to
take it in very tiny steps, starting with just displaying a blank
screen, then a maze, and eventually getting to the point where there's
a working game. Long term, I'd love to get network multiplayer
working.
